# ðŸŽ¯ Lucky Draw (Move Smart Contract)

A simple Aptos Move contract that allows an admin to create a lucky draw event and lets players join by paying an entry fee.

## Features
- Initialize a lucky draw event by the admin.
- Players can join the draw by paying a fixed entry fee.
- Stores a list of participant addresses on-chain.

## Contract
- *init_draw(admin)* â†’ Creates a new lucky draw event under the adminâ€™s account.
- *enter_draw(player, admin_addr, entry_fee)* â†’ Allows a player to join the lucky draw by paying the entry fee to the admin.
